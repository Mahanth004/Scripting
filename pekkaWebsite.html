        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>P.E.K.K.A (Perfect Enraged Knight Killer of Assassins) is a mechanical warrior in a suit of armor. His
            appearance
            is imposing, featuring a sleek, black suit of armor adorned with glowing blue accents and a fearsome helmet
            with red eyes. He wields a gigantic sword that glows with energy, signifying his immense power. P.E.K.K.A
            is
            well known for his ability to deal massive single-target damage, making him an excellent choice for taking
            down
            tanks and high-hitpoint units. This makes him nearly impossible to defeat and on the other hand, he gets
            countered relatively easily when alone.</p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>P.E.K.K.A's animations are designed to make him a visually striking and imposing character in Clash Royale.
            His
            relentless pursuit of a single target and devastating sword swings are key elements of his identity. The
            PEKKA is a card that is able to dominate in some matchups but also feels powerless in others due to its slow
            swing and movement speed. In a best-case scenario, PEKKA is able to defend your enemy's attack, then
            counter- push with support. Because of her ability to counter a plethora of cards and remain at high health,
            your primary goal is to counter-attack. However, due to the difficulty to get a PEKKA to your opponent's
            tower, you sometimes have to rely on damage from your support cards and spells.</p>

        <h2>Special Skills</h2>
        <p>P.E.K.K.A's unique ability is his precise targeting. He focuses all his attention on a single enemy target
            and relentlessly pursues it. This targeting animation is a key part of his identity as a high-damage
            single-target troop. This feature makes him an excellent choice for eliminating specific threats within the
            enemy's army, even if they are surrounded by other troops.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="AttackStyle">
        <h2>Attack Style</h2>
        <p>P.E.K.K.A's attack animation is one of his most distinctive features. When he attacks, he swings his
            massive
            sword with immense force, dealing extremely high single-target damage. The animation showcases his raw power
            and
            precision in combat.</p>

    <section id="HitStyle" class="alternate">
        <h2>Hit Style</h2>
        <p>When P.E.K.K.A takes damage, his armor sparks and flashes, indicating that he's under attack. Despite his
            high
            hitpoints, this animation shows that even the mightiest warriors can be vulnerable in battle.</p>

    <section id="Strategy to maximize the potential of PEKKA">
        <h2>Strategy</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>

            <li><i>Elixir Management:</i></li>

            P.E.K.K.A is a high elixir cost card (7 elixir), so managing your elixir effectively is crucial. Don't
            overcommit by deploying P.E.K.K.A too early, as it can leave you vulnerable to counter-pushes. Save him for
            when he's most needed.
            <p></p>

            <li><i>Placement:</i> </li>

            When defending with P.E.K.K.A, place him in the middle of your side of the arena. This gives him more time
            to engage enemy troops before they reach your towers. His powerful single-target attacks make him a great
            defender against most enemy pushes.
            <p></p>

            <li><i>Counterpush Opportunities:</i></li>

            P.E.K.K.A is also excellent for counterpushing. Once he's eliminated the enemy's push, place support troops
            behind him to transform your defense into an offensive attack. This can catch your opponent off guard and
            put pressure on their side of the arena.
            <p></p>

            <li><i>Be Mindful of Air Units:</i></li>

            P.E.K.K.A can only target ground units. To counter air units, ensure your deck includes anti-air troops or
            spells like Baby Dragon, Electro Wizard, or Arrows. These will help deal with any flying threats your
            opponent may deploy.
            <p></p>

            <li><i>Practice and Timing:</i></li>

            Using P.E.K.K.A effectively takes practice. Mastering the timing of your card deployments and understanding
            when to deploy him for defense, counter-push, or as a tank for support troops will significantly improve
            your success with this card.
            <p></p>

            <div>Remember, P.E.K.K.A is a versatile card with a strong defensive and counter-push potential. By
                integrating
                him into a well-constructed deck and implementing these strategies, you can become a formidable Clash
                Royale
                player and make the most of P.E.K.K.A's capabilities.</div>
